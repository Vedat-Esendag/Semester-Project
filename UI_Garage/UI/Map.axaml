They produce heat with a number of traditional heat-only boilers as well as units that combine the production of heat with the production/consumption of electricity (CHPs). They are planning the heat schedules manually but now they want to cost optimize their production. The goal of the project is to define heat schedules for all available production units with the lowest possible expenses and the highest profit on the electricity market."
